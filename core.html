        I’m Anas — a 16-year-old web developer and freelance designer focused on building clean, modern, and high-performing digital experiences.
        Even at a young age, I’ve invested countless hours into mastering front-end development, UI/UX principles, and responsive design. I specialize in crafting visually appealing websites that are fast, functional, and tailored to each client’s needs.

        I approach every project with the mindset of a creator and a problem-solver: understanding your vision, improving the user experience, and delivering results that help your brand stand out. Whether it's a personal website, a business landing page, or a custom portfolio, I bring creativity, precision, and fresh modern design to the table.

        I previously built a full online store for a gym owner to help him sell his own fitness products. Since then, I’ve transitioned to focusing on front-end development and user experience, but this project highlights my earlier full-stack work.

        I work primarily with HTML and CSS, building clean, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces. These technologies allow me to create well-structured layouts, smooth styling, and modern web designs that work across all devices. I focus on writing organized, maintainable code and bringing ideas to life with strong attention to detail and user experience.
